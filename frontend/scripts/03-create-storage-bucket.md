# Supabase Storage Bucket Setup

You need to create a storage bucket in your Supabase dashboard for storing meme images.

## Steps:

1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to **Storage** in the left sidebar
3. Click **Create a new bucket**
4. Name it: `images`
5. Under **Access settings**, select **Public** (so images can be viewed without authentication)
6. Click **Create bucket**

That's it! The code will automatically upload images to this bucket.
