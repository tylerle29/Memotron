# Memotron
Summary:
An agentic AI used for translating the cultural context of memes for industry purposes like marketing and intra-organizational communication.

Inciting Reason: 
Marketing Research involving cultural references like MEMEs are often lost between the generational gaps. Because of this, market researchers look for ways to make this process more extensive and easier. However, most agentic agents, including ChatGPT, have a difficult time deciphering the cultural context of memes.

We are able to generate reports and have of agentic AI preform better at understanding the cultural context of memes. 

Future Work:
We plan to expand this beyond memes towards general culturally relevant events and expand the modality of media it can take in.
